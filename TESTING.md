# Backend Testing Progress & Plans

## Current Status ✅

### What's Working
- **Jest Configuration**: Fully configured with TypeScript support
- **Test Environment**: Separate `.env.test` file with SQLite configuration
- **Unit Tests**: 17 passing tests covering business logic
- **Test Utilities**: Helper functions ready for database integration (when fixed)

### Test Coverage
1. **Access Control Tests** (`__tests__/access-control.test.ts`)
   - Role-based permissions (admin, owner, guest)
   - Bid filtering logic
   - Contract access controls
   - User profile permissions

2. **Hook Tests** (`__tests__/hooks.test.ts`)
   - Contract logging business logic
   - Create/update/delete operations
   - Audit trail functionality

3. **Setup Tests** (`__tests__/setup.test.ts`)
   - Environment variable loading
   - Keystone module imports

## Current Architecture

│   ├── hooks.test.ts              ✅ Working unit tests

└── .env.test                      ✅ SQLite config
```

## Issues Identified ❌

### 1. Database Provider Mismatch
- **Problem**: `schema.prisma` generated for PostgreSQL, tests need SQLite
- **Error**: `the URL must start with the protocol postgresql://` 
- **Root Cause**: Keystone generates schema based on current environment

### 2. TypeScript Complexity
- **Problem**: Keystone uses complex union types for access controls
- **Current Fix**: Type guards and proper type assertions (no `any` usage)
- **Status**: Tests pass but `tsc --noEmit` still has errors

### 3. Missing PrismaClient Integration
- **Problem**: `getContext()` fails because PrismaClient isn't properly initialized
- **Error**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'PrismaClient')`

## Solutions Attempted

### ✅ What Worked
1. **Type Guards**: Created proper type checking instead of using `any`
2. **Schema Import Fix**: Removed strict typing from `schema.ts`
3. **Test Environment**: Separate config for SQLite
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful failures in test utilities

### ❌ What Didn't Work
1. **Direct SQLite Schema**: Can't just change DATABASE_URL, need proper generation
2. **Simple Type Assertions**: Keystone types too complex for simple `as` assertions

## Testing Strategy Decision

### Unit Tests (Current Approach) ✅
**Pros:**
- Fast execution
- No database dependencies
- Tests business logic in isolation
- Reliable and deterministic

**Coverage:**
- Access control logic
- Hook business rules
- Validation functions
- Session management

### Database Integration Tests (Future Need) ⚠️
**Required For:**
- GraphQL query testing
- Schema validation
- Relationship constraints
- Full backend-frontend integration
- SvelteKit app testing

## Next Steps & Plans

### Phase 1: Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Fix Database Integration**
   - Create test-specific Keystone config that generates SQLite schema
   - Solve PrismaClient initialization for tests
   - Enable `test-setup.ts` utilities

2. **Expand Database Tests**
   - User creation and admin assignment
   - Team/Player CRUD operations
   - Contract business logic
   - Relationship testing

### Phase 2: Backend Complete
3. **GraphQL API Testing**
   - Query/mutation testing
   - Authentication flows
   - Error handling
   - Rate limiting (if implemented)

4. **Business Logic Integration**
   - Contract hooks with real database
   - Access control with actual sessions
   - Data validation end-to-end

### Phase 3: Frontend Integration
5. **SvelteKit Testing Setup**
   - GraphQL client testing against real backend
   - Component integration tests
   - Authentication flow testing

6. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Full user journeys
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Real database scenarios

## Technical Debt & Decisions

### Known Issues to Address
1. **TypeScript Strictness**: Still have type errors in strict mode
2. **Schema Generation**: Need dynamic provider switching for tests
3. **Test Data Management**: Proper fixtures and factories needed

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **No `any` Types**: Use type guards instead of type assertions
2. **Separate Test Environment**: `.env.test` for isolation
3. **Jest Over Native Node**: Better TypeScript integration
4. **Unit-First Approach**: Build reliable foundation before integration

### Key Files to Remember
- `test-setup.ts`: Contains database utilities (currently disabled)
- `jest.config.js`: TypeScript configuration with `isolatedModules`
- `.env.test`: SQLite configuration for tests
- Type guards in test files: Pattern to follow for future tests

## Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with watch mode
npm run test:watch

# TypeScript check (currently has errors)
npx tsc --noEmit

# Generate fresh schema (uses current env)
rm schema.prisma && npm run build
```

## Success Metrics
- ✅ 17/17 unit tests passing
- ✅ Clean test separation (no database dependencies in unit tests)
- ✅ Proper TypeScript handling (tests compile and run)
- ❌ Database integration tests (blocked on schema generation)
- ❌ Full type safety (some TS errors remain)

The foundation is solid - we have reliable unit tests covering core business logic. The database integration work is the next major milestone needed for both backend completion and frontend testing.
